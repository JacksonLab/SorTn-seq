SorTnSeq.R processes insertion site plot files to generate a counts table per feature in the *Serratia* sp. ATCC 39006 genome. 

Genome feature intervals are defined in serratia_master_features_table.xlsx

SorTnSeq_statistics.R analyses the counts data to identify significantly enriched features in the low and high expression bins.
