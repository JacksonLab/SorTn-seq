## SorTn-seq overview

SorTn-seq uses fluorescent reporters, saturation transposon mutagenesis and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate bacterial mutants with altered gene expression. Sorted cell pools are deep sequenced to identify transposon insertion sites and the enrichment of mutants in high or low fluorescence bins is used to identify putative regulators of gene expression.

### Data analysis overview



Figure 9. Summary of input and output files of the SorTn-seq analysis. FASTQ files are first processed to assess quality and remove adaptor contamination in the terminal window (shell). Processed files are fed into the TraDIS pipeline to identify the transposon tag and map reads to the reference genome (.fasta file). The TraDIS pipeline summarizes mapping and insertion statistics (.stats file), as well as producing sample-specific files, such reads per nucleotide position (.plot files) and Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files and indices (.bam and .bam.bai). In the terminal, BAM files are converted to Browser Extensible Data (BED) files (.bed) for subsequent analysis in R. To assign mapped reads to specific genomic features, an organism-specific feature table ([genome.prefix]_features_sortnseq.xlsx) is first generated in R (SorTnSeq_format_features.R), which parses RefSeq General Feature Format (GFF) files and adds intergenic regions as features. The feature table, BED files, and user-supplied sample information (sample_metadata.xlsx) are used to generate tables of read counts, insertion counts, and insertion index (number of insertions / feature length) for each sample (.xlsx files). To identify differentially enriched features, the unique insertion table (SorTnSeq_unique_insertions.xlsx) and insertion index table (SorTnSeq_table_insertion_index.xlsx) are processed using edgeR (SorTnSeq_analysis.R). A table summarizing feature enrichment (SorTnSeq_results_depleted_unique_insertions.xlsx) is generated along with plots that summarize the results (.pdf).
